BFS Problem Checklist (Silver → Gold)

1) Is every move equal cost?
   → Yes → BFS
   → No  → consider Dijkstra / 0-1 BFS
   My trigger:
    - If every transition costs exactly 1, BFS preserves shortest order.
    - If edge cost can be 0 or 1 (like following arrows for free),
    normal BFS breaks and 0-1 BFS is required.



2) Is (position) enough to describe a state?
   → If future choices depend on extra conditions,
     add them into the state.
    My trigger:
    - If a special action (like breaking walls) affects future possibilities,
    reaching the same cell with different usage counts is not equivalent.



3) Can the same cell reached in different ways
   lead to different future possibilities?
   → Yes → visited must include extra dimensions.
   My trigger:
    - If two paths reach the same cell but leave me in different situations,
    a simple 2D visited array is incorrect.



4) What is the main resource or constraint?
   Examples:
   - remaining breaks
   - remaining time
   - parity (even / odd step)
   - mode / key possession
   My trigger:
    - Limited resources can cause different shortest distances
    to the same cell depending on how much resource was used.



5) What does dist[state] actually mean?
   → distance to reach THIS EXACT state.
   My definition:
    - dist[state] stores the shortest path to a specific situation,
    not just whether a cell was visited.



6) How is the final answer selected?
   → min / max over all valid end states.
   My rule:
    - State variables (like used) affect the answer,
    but are not necessarily part of the final objective.
