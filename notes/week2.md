# Week 2 Log — Vectors, Strings, and Functions

 Learned:
- vector push_back, size(), range-for
- string basic usage + getline
- frequency counting with vector<int>
- word counting logic with bool inWord

 Concepts:
- O(n) complexity
- bool = true / false state
- static_cast<unsigned char>(c) for safe char
- getline reads the full line (includes spaces)

 Achievements:
- Wrote 3 complete C++ programs
- Understood input handling for USACO Bronze
