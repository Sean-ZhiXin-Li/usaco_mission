# W01 · 2025-10-14 → 2025-10-20

**Foundation week: built the toolchain, verified stream behavior, and completed fast I/O template setup.**

---

## Deliverables (Completed)

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `hello.cpp` | Verified compiler, namespace usage, and standard output pipeline |
| `sum_two.cpp` | Implemented arithmetic input/output, introduced long long for overflow safety |
| `max3.cpp` | Implemented EOF-driven multi-case input loop with fast I/O |

All programs compiled with `g++` under MinGW and executed successfully inside `src/week1/`.

## Key Technical Takeaways

### I/O and Streams
- `cout` writes to an **output stream**
- Data is first stored in a **buffer**, not printed immediately
- `'\n'` = newline only; `endl` = newline **+ flush** (slower)
- USACO prefers `'\n'` for performance

### Fast I/O Setup
| Line | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `ios::sync_with_stdio(false);` | Detach C++ streams from C stdio for speed |
| `cin.tie(nullptr);` | Prevent automatic flush before input |

### Input Models Learned
| Model | Example | When used |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Single-shot | `sum_two.cpp` | One-time input |
| EOF-based | `max3.cpp` | Competitive programming style |

## Compile Pipeline (Final form for OJ)

```
g++ <file>.cpp -O2 -std=gnu++17 -o <file>.exe
```

Example used this week:
```
g++ max3.cpp -O2 -std=gnu++17 -o max3.exe
```

---

## Common Pitfalls Resolved

| Issue | Fixed by |
|------|-----------|
| Mistaking `-O2` as `-02` | (O = letter “O”, stands for Optimize) |
| Incorrect spacing in `-std=gnu++17` | '=' must not be split |
| Expecting `endl` to behave like `\n` | learned flushing behavior |

## Mini Checklist

- [x] Compiler verified
- [x] Fast I/O configured
- [x] EOF input model understood
- [x] `.cpp → .exe` pipeline internalized
- [x] Long long usage confirmed

End of Week 1 — baseline established.
