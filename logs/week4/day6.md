# Week 4 Day 6 — From “Can Write” to “Independent Modeling”

## What I shipped today

I rebuilt the full reasoning for Hoof Paper Scissors Minus One and verified that I understand what a guaranteed win means under simultaneous decision-making. I also completed a full modeling breakdown instead of relying on implementation intuition.

## One modeling rule that is now non-negotiable

A guaranteed win requires the existence of one fixed action that defeats all possible opponent choices, not different actions for different cases.

## What I will do next time without hesitation

When I see words like “guaranteed”, “always”, or “regardless”, I will first determine the decision timing (simultaneous vs sequential) and immediately search for a counterexample to my initial intuition.
