## What I tested today
Repeated BFS judgment and full BFS implementation on Milk Pails (Silver).

## What worked
I could correctly identify state, transitions, and visited meaning before coding.

## What I will watch for tomorrow
Whether I can rebuild the BFS from an empty skeleton without referencing code.
