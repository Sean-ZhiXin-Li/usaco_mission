# Week3 Day1 Log

Today I wrote and ran my first C++ program in the usaco_mission repo.
I learned:
- vector: dynamic array, continuous memory, supports fast indexing.
- map: tree-based key-value structure with automatic ordering.
- set: auto-sorting + dedup using balanced binary tree.

I modified demo_vector() to:
- print original order
- print sorted order
- print only even numbers

I can now compile and run C++ using:
g++ src/week3/play_map_set.cpp -o play
.\play

Next:
Start Day2 — stack, queue, and TheAlgorithms reading practice.
