# TheAlgorithms Reading - Day2

I checked one stack implementation.
It stores elements in an array and uses an index as the top pointer.
The interface includes push, pop, empty, and top.
The code checks empty/full cases before accessing elements.
I don't fully understand all details yet, but I recognize the structure.
