# Week3 Day2 Log

Today I learned stack (LIFO) and queue (FIFO) and practiced both STL usage and manual implementation.

I implemented:
- MyStack using vector
- MyQueue using deque
- A bracket matching problem using stack

I also integrated stack and queue into the existing playground code.

Project bridge:
- Queue can model pending tasks or events in my spacecraft simulation.
- Stack can model state history or undo operations for debugging controller decisions.
