Q1. When does BFS strictly apply?
A1:
BFS strictly applies when all state transitions have equal cost (or cost 0/1 handled by layered BFS), and the problem asks for the shortest or earliest number of steps.

Q2. What is the minimum information a State must contain?
A2:
A State must contain enough information to uniquely represent the current position or situation so that future decisions and transitions are fully determined.

Q3. What is the true meaning of Visited?
A3:
Visited indicates that this state has already been reached with the minimum number of steps, and revisiting it would not produce a better result.

Q4. When is the final answer NOT directly stored inside the BFS (e.g., not simply dist[target])?
A4:
When BFS is only used to explore reachability or traversal order, and the final answer is computed separately during or after traversal rather than taken directly from a distance array.

Q5. What is the fundamental difference between Bronze-level BFS and Silver-level BFS?
A5:
Bronze-level BFS usually works on explicit grids or graphs with obvious states, where the answer is directly dist[target]. Silver-level BFS requires careful state modeling, and the state is no longer just a position but may include additional conditions.

Self-level:
Silver (early stage)

Reason:
I understand how BFS works but still hesitate when defining the correct state and identifying where the final answer comes from.
